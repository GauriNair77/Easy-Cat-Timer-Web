## What is the use?

Countdown.

<br/>

But maybe it can help you work and learn better.

I usually work 25 minutes and rest for 5 minutes.

So I need a timer to help me.

Before working, I will set a 25 minute countdown and start working. When the alarm goes off, I will put down my work and take a break.

This method of work is called "the Pomodoro Technique", and you may try this method as well.

Now, you can use this software to start a new countdown right away~

<br/>

In addition, there are 2 cute kittens in this software.I hope this lovely timer can bring you some relaxation and happiness when you work and study.
